Analyse EXERCISE8_MMX with WinDbg

1. Use WinDbg to evaluate code. Analyse the code structure of unter.asm debugging EXERCISE8_MMX.exe under C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE8_MMX\Debug
2. Start WinDbg
3. Start debugging using "Get started with WinDbg (user mode)" on position "Open your own application and attach WinDbg" and execute steps 1. to 4.
4. Apply "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE8_MMX.txt", steps 1. to 4.
5. Open over WinDbg menu ot topic "Source" the Intel_MMX_Intrinsics.c source file.
6. Set breackpoint on line 138 Start "Go".
7. With "Step Into" execute INTRINSIC _mm_madd_pi16(_bv[i], _cv[i]).  
   Use command !analyze -v to analyse MMX registers and memory values 
   using further the  "Step Into" menu feature.
8. Use WinDbg menu ot topic topic "View\Registers", MMX registers "View\Disassembly" 
   to understand the effect of MMX intrinsics on packed data.
