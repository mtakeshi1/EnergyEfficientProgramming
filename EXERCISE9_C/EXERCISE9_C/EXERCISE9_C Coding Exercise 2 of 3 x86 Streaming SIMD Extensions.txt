Analyse EXERCISE9_C with WinDbg

1. Use WinDbg to evaluate code. Analyse the code structure of unter.asm debugging EXERCISE9_C.exe under C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE9_C\Debug 
2. Start WinDbg
3. Start debugging using "Get started with WinDbg (user mode)" on position "Open your own application and attach WinDbg" and execute steps 1. to 4.
4. Apply "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE9_C.txt", steps 1. to 4.
5. Open over WinDbg menu ot topic "Source" the VSP_SISD_float.c source file.
6. Set breackpoint on line 62 and  start "Go".
7. With "Step Into" execute code line VDP_f[0] += vector_af[i] * vector_bf[i] in assembly language.  Use command
	!analyze -v
   to analyse x86 register and memory values using further the  "Step Into" menu feature.
8. Use WinDbg menu ot topic "View" for more information.
