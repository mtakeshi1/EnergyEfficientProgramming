Analyse EXERCISE9_SSE_ASM with WinDbg

1. Use WinDbg to evaluate code. Analyse the code structure of unter.asm debugging EXERCISE9_SSE_ASM.exe under C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE9_SSE_ASM\Debug
2. Start WinDbg
3. Start debugging using "Get started with WinDbg (user mode)" on position "Open your own application and attach WinDbg" and execute steps 1. to 4.
4. Apply "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE9_SSE_ASM.txt", steps 1. to 4.
5. Open over WinDbg menu ot topic "Source" the VSP_SIMD_SSE_float.c source file.
6. Set breackpoint on line 89 and  start "Go".
7. With "Step Into" execute code line 89 until 121 in assembly language.  Use command
	!analyze -v
   to analyse XMM register and memory values using further the  "Step Into" menu feature.
8. Use Debugging menu, topic "View\Registers", XMM registers "View\Disassembly" 
   to understand the effect of ‚Å´SSE instructions on packed data.
