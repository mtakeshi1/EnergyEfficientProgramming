* CPI Rate

Code to test:
C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE11_VTune_SISD\Debug\EXERCISE11_VTune_SISD.exe

Code to measure:
C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE11_VTune_SISD\Release\EXERCISE11_VTune_SISD.exe
Tasks:
1.  Build a Console Application project EXERCISE11_VTune for MxM_MULT_SEQ_RELEASE.c, MxM_MULT_SSE_RELEASE.c.
2.  Build FIRST the project EXERCISE11_VTune.exe with RELEASE x86 option ONLY for MxM_MULT_SEQ_RELEASE.c
3.  Build a Vtune project for EXERCISE11_VTune.exe
4.  Analyse EXERCISE11_VTune.exe  with the Intel's VTune Profiler 2021.3 tool. Notice the results
	in the way presented in Read Me EXERCISE11_VTune.txt for MxM_MULT_SEQ_RELEASE.c.
5.	Build SECOND the project EXERCISE11_VTune.exe with RELEASE x86 option ONLY for MxM_MULT_SSE.c.
6.  Repeat step 4 for MxM_MULT_SSE_RELEASE.c. Notice the results in the way presented in Read Me EXERCISE11_VTune.txt .
7. 	Compare the Results unter points 4. and 6.
