Analyse EXERCISE8_SSE with WinDbg

1. Use WinDbg to evaluate code. Analyse the code structure of unter.asm debugging EXERCISE8_SSE.exe under C:\PROJEKTE\EEP_Exercises_WinDbg\EXERCISE8_SSE\Debug
2. Start WinDbg
3. Start debugging using "Get started with WinDbg (user mode)" on position "Open your own application and attach WinDbg" and execute steps 1. to 4.
4. Apply "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE8_SSE.txt", steps 1. to 4.
5. Open over WinDbg menu ot topic "Source" the Intel_SSE_Intrinsics.c source file.
6. Set breackpoint on line 124 Start "Go".
7. With "Step Into" execute INTRINSIC _mm_storeu_si128(&vR, _mm_add_epi32(vR, _mm_mullo_epi32(vA, vB))).  
   Use command !analyze -v
   to analyse XMM register and memory values using further the  "Step Into" menu feature.
8. Use WinDbg menu ot topic topic "View\Registers", XMM registers "View\Disassembly" 
   to understand the effect of SSE intrinsics on packed data.
