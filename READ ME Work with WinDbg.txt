Work with WinDbg and use WinDbg to evaluate code

1. Install WinDbg from https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/windbg-preview/9PGJGD53TN86. 
2. Go to Store-App and start it
3. You got WinDbg Preview.
4. Put WinDbg Preview to Windows "Start" menu and open it.
5. Download EEP_Projektmappe_WinDbg.zip into C:\PROJECT and decompress it. Now you have the right path
   to apply the command lines from "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE_xyz.txt" to work with WinDbg Preview.
6. Start debugging using "Get started with WinDbg (user mode)" on position "Open your own application and attach WinDbg" and execute steps 1. to 4.
(https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/getting-started-with-windbg#summary-of-commands)
7. Apply the command lines in "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE_xyz.txt" files to every EXERCISE to debug executable code.
8. First go to menu tab "File" and "Launch executable". Go to the *.exe file you want to debug.
9. Go to menu "Source" and "Open Source File"
10. Go to folder where the source code of "EXERCISE_xyz" is and select it.
11. Apply the command lines in "WinDbg_user_app_command lines_EXERCISE_xyz.txt".
12. Go to menu "View" and select "Locals", "Registers", "Disassembly" and "Memory".

So you will be abble to inspect the values of variebles to check the semantic of code and the way of how instructions 
are executed by the CPU.
